# aim
## Introduction
This repo contains my neovim configuration (**a**bhi's nv**im** == **aim**). The config files are fine tuned for windows operating system, but can be replicated on any operating system with some minor changes. The LSP and DAP configuration implemented are targeted to make neovim a fast and lightweight Python IDE.
