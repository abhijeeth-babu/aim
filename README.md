# aim
## Introduction
This repo contains my neovim configuration (**a**bhi's nv**im** == **aim**). The config files are fine tuned for windows operating system, but can be replicated on any operating system with some minor changes. The configurations are designed to make neovim into a fast and minimalistic text editor on Windows.
